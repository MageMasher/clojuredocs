# Clojure's Core Library

Clojure's standard library, i.e. the `clojure.*` namespaces, provide a
ton of general-purpose functionality for writing robust, maintainable
applications.

Getting a handle on all the functionality you'll want to use can be a
little daunting at first, especially if you're coming from
object-oriented languages like Java, Ruby, or Python, where behavior
is grouped using classes. In Clojure, namespaces are used to group
similar behavior and state, and we've outlined a few of the core
namespaces to help you find what you're looking for.
